# Server-Side Session Fix

## The Problem

**Issue:** Server-side session was not working because:
1. Browser client was storing session in `localStorage` only
2. Server-side code was looking for session in cookies
3. Mismatch between client and server storage mechanisms

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ Login works on client-side
- ❌ Server-side can't detect logged-in user
- ❌ Protected routes don't work properly
- ❌ Page refreshes lose authentication state on server

## The Root Cause

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// lib/supabaseClient.ts
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
    storageKey: 'sb-auth-token',
    storage: window.localStorage,  // ❌ Only stores in localStorage
    autoRefreshToken: true,
  },
});
```

**Problem:** 
- Session stored in browser `localStorage`
- Cookies not being set automatically
- Server can't read `localStorage` (browser-only)
- Server components can't access user session

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// lib/supabaseClient.ts
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr';

export const supabase = createBrowserClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
// ✅ Automatically manages BOTH localStorage AND cookies
```

**Solution:**
- Uses `@supabase/ssr` instead of `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Automatically sets cookies that server can read
- Also maintains localStorage for client-side access
- Proper cookie management for Next.js

## The Fix

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated Browser Client (`lib/supabaseClient.ts`)
```typescript
// Before
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
export const supabase = createClient(url, key, { auth: { storage: localStorage } });

// After
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr';
export const supabase = createBrowserClient(url, key);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Sets HTTP-only cookies automatically
- ✅ Maintains localStorage for client-side
- ✅ Server can now read session from cookies
- ✅ Works seamlessly with middleware

#### 2. Simplified Auth Functions (`lib/auth.ts`)
```typescript
// Before
export async function signInWithEmail({ email, password }) {
  const result = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });
  if (result.data.session) {
    await supabase.auth.setSession(result.data.session); // Redundant
  }
  return result;
}

// After
export async function signInWithEmail({ email, password }) {
  return supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });
  // @supabase/ssr handles cookies automatically ✅
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow:
```
1. User submits login form (Client Component)
   ↓
2. signInWithEmail() called
   ↓
3. Supabase authenticates user
   ↓
4. @supabase/ssr automatically:
   - Sets cookies (for server)     ✅
   - Sets localStorage (for client) ✅
   ↓
5. Redirect based on role
```

### Session Access:

#### Client-Side (Browser):
```typescript
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabaseClient';

// Reads from localStorage OR cookies
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
```

#### Server-Side (Next.js):
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';

const supabase = await createClient();
// Reads from cookies ✅
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
```

#### Middleware:
```typescript
// Reads and refreshes cookies automatically
const supabase = createServerClient(url, key, {
  cookies: { get, set, remove }  // Cookie handlers
});
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
```

## What @supabase/ssr Does

The `@supabase/ssr` package provides:

1. **`createBrowserClient()`** - For Client Components
   - Manages both localStorage and cookies
   - Sets httpOnly cookies for security
   - Compatible with server-side reading

2. **`createServerClient()`** - For Server Components & Middleware
   - Reads cookies from requests
   - Sets cookies in responses
   - Refreshes expired sessions

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Login and Cookie Check
```bash
1. Open DevTools → Application
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
3. Login with test credentials
4. Check Application → Cookies
   - Should see: sb-access-token ✅
   - Should see: sb-refresh-token ✅
5. Check Application → Local Storage
   - Should also see: sb-* keys ✅
```

### Test 2: Server-Side Session
```bash
1. Login successfully
2. Navigate to /admin/dashboard
3. Server should detect user ✅
4. Should not redirect to /login
5. Check Network tab → Headers
   - Cookies should be sent with request ✅
```

### Test 3: Page Refresh
```bash
1. Login and navigate to /admin/dashboard
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Should stay logged in ✅
4. Should not see "Access Denied"
5. User info should display correctly
```

### Test 4: Cross-Tab Session
```bash
1. Login in Tab 1
2. Open Tab 2 → Navigate to /admin/dashboard
3. Should be logged in ✅
4. Logout in Tab 1
5. Tab 2 should detect logout (on next request)
```

## Before vs After

### Before (Broken):
```
Login → localStorage only
        ↓
        ❌ No cookies set
        ↓
Server: Can't read session
        ↓
Redirects to /login
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Login → localStorage + Cookies
        ↓
        ✅ Both storage methods set
        ↓
Server: Reads cookies successfully
        ↓
User stays logged in
```

## Cookie Details

The following cookies are set by `@supabase/ssr`:

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Properties |
|------------|---------|------------|
| `sb-access-token` | JWT access token | httpOnly, secure, sameSite |
| `sb-refresh-token` | Refresh token | httpOnly, secure, sameSite |

**Security:**
- `httpOnly`: JavaScript can't access (XSS protection)
- `secure`: Only sent over HTTPS in production
- `sameSite`: CSRF protection

## Build Status

```
✅ Compiled successfully
✅ TypeScript validation passed
✅ All routes generated correctly
✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Browser client now uses `@supabase/ssr`
✅ **Result:** Sessions stored in BOTH cookies and localStorage
✅ **Impact:** Server-side components can now read user session
✅ **Benefit:** Proper SSR with authentication

Run `npm run dev` and test the login flow!
